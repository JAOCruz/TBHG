    lyrics: `🎵 "Double Life Gooner"

[Intro]
(Hey Dex, where you goin' at night, bro?)
Daytime: lab coat…
Nighttime: WiFi load…
Bay Harbor Gooner in the cut, yuh!

[Chorus]
Day job Dexter, lookin' clean with the slides,
Night shift Gooner, yeah I'm dead in the eyes.
Miami sun, but the curtains always drawn,
Neighbors think I'm normal — they so f—in' wrong.

Bay Harbor Gooner, not a butcher anymore,
I'm a fiend with the laptop, locked behind the door.
Plastic on the windows, candles on the floor,
Harry's Code don't cover what I'm searchin' for.

[Verse 1]
Blood spatter analyst, but the spatter look sus,
FBI lookin' — but it's lotion, not guts.
LaGuerta like "Dex, why you sweaty every case?"
I just smile, fake grin, wipe the screen from my face.

Doakes on my trail, think he caught me in a bind,
But I'm deep in incognito, tabs thirty-nine.
A killer in the streets, but a clown on the net,
Gooner Morgan legacy, Showtime never met.

[Chorus]
Day job Dexter, lookin' clean with the slides,
Night shift Gooner, yeah I'm dead in the eyes.
Miami sun, but the curtains always drawn,
Neighbors think I'm normal — they so f—in' wrong.

Bay Harbor Gooner, not a butcher anymore,
I'm a fiend with the laptop, locked behind the door.
Plastic on the windows, candles on the floor,
Harry's Code don't cover what I'm searchin' for.

[Verse 2]
Rita cookin' dinner, kids watchin' TV,
Meanwhile I'm distracted, brain stuck on PC.
Masuka crack a joke, think I'm quiet from the trauma,
But the real dark passenger's got me searchin' for Madonna.

Ocean in the night, used to dump 'em off the pier,
Now I'm sittin' with my headphones, WiFi crystal clear.
Slide box dusty, no more trophies, I'm done,
Only thing I'm catchin' now? Vitamin D from the sun.

[Bridge]
Miami Vice drip, boat life cooler,
Everybody scared of the Bay Harbor Butcher…
But the joke's on y'all, truth comin' sooner,
I ain't killin' bodies, I'm the Bay Harbor Gooner.

[Final Chorus]
Day job Dexter, lookin' clean with the slides,
Night shift Gooner, yeah I'm dead in the eyes.
Miami sun, but the curtains always drawn,
Neighbors think I'm normal — they so f—in' wrong.

Bay Harbor Gooner, not a butcher anymore,
I'm a fiend with the laptop, locked behind the door.
Plastic on the windows, candles on the floor,
Harry's Code don't cover what I'm searchin' for.

[Outro]
Deb kick the door, she like "Dex, what's the play?"
I shut the screen quick, "Sis, it's just anime…"
Not a hero, not a villain, I'm a looner,
Dexter Morgan… the Bay Harbor Gooner.`

    lyrics: `[Intro]
Yeah…
Miami nights, red tide drip…
They used to call him Butcher…
Now it's Bay Harbor Gooner, bih!

[Chorus]
I'm the Bay Harbor Gooner, creep at night with a mask on,
Neighbors think I'm normal, but my hard drive full of mad songs,
Plastic wrap the scene, I ain't talkin' 'bout no condom,
Dexter with the blade, but I'm goofy, yeah I'm random.

Bay Harbor Gooner, yeah I'm spinnin' like a rumor,
Catch me in the Everglades, feds trackin' on a scooter,
Deb sayin', "What the f— Dex?" I say, "Nah I'm just a gooner,"
Not a butcher anymore, girl, I'm a certified consumer.

[Verse 1]
Woke up in Miami, got a morgue pass,
Blood slides in a box, like Pokémon cards stacked.
Lundy lookin' for me, but I'm hidin' in the sewer,
I ain't killin' serials — I'm a cereal Cheerios gooner.

Rita hit my flip phone, "Dex, you actin' kinda strange,"
I'm in the bathroom tweakin', Chrome tabs up, deranged.
Not the Code of Harry, nah, the Code of Horny Harry,
Staring at the bay tide, lotion bottle legendary.

[Chorus]
I'm the Bay Harbor Gooner, creep at night with a mask on,
Neighbors think I'm normal, but my hard drive full of mad songs,
Plastic wrap the scene, I ain't talkin' 'bout no condom,
Dexter with the blade, but I'm goofy, yeah I'm random.

Bay Harbor Gooner, yeah I'm spinnin' like a rumor,
Catch me in the Everglades, feds trackin' on a scooter,
Deb sayin', "What the f— Dex?" I say, "Nah I'm just a gooner,"
Not a butcher anymore, girl, I'm a certified consumer.

[Verse 2]
Slide box trophies? Nah, I got tabs open,
Miami sun hot, AC barely copin'.
Masuka hit my line, said "Bro, you need help,"
But I'm busy with the laptop, private browsing to myself.

Got the kill room vibe, but it's sticky, not bloody,
Morgan family dinner, actin' wholesome, all buddy-buddy.
Inside I'm a menace, Showtime couldn't show this,
From butcher to gooner, yeah the fandom won't condone this.

[Bridge]
In the Bay with the plastic sheets, (sheeeesh)
But I ain't killin', I'm just beatin' beats.
Doakes in the shadows like "Surprise, m—f—,"
But I shut the laptop quick, "Bruh, I'm just a sucker."

[Chorus]
I'm the Bay Harbor Gooner, creep at night with a mask on,
Neighbors think I'm normal, but my hard drive full of mad songs,
Plastic wrap the scene, I ain't talkin' 'bout no condom,
Dexter with the blade, but I'm goofy, yeah I'm random.

Bay Harbor Gooner, yeah I'm spinnin' like a rumor,
Catch me in the Everglades, feds trackin' on a scooter,
Deb sayin', "What the f— Dex?" I say, "Nah I'm just a gooner,"
Not a butcher anymore, girl, I'm a certified consumer.

[Outro]
They called me the Butcher, now the memes took over…
Dexter Morgan…
Bay Harbor Gooner, forever…`

    lyrics: `🎵 "Full Gooner Mode" (Dark R&B Parody)

[Verse 1]
Miami lights fade into the glass,
Nobody knows what's under the mask.
Daytime I'm calm, smile in control,
But nightfall whispers… it's taking a toll.

I hide in shadows, craving the glow,
A hunger inside me that nobody knows.
Blood on my hands, but tonight it's not cold,
I'm drownin' in silence… full gooner mode.

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't escape it, it's pullin' me deeper,
A secret I keep, I'm my own grim reaper.
Not the Code of Harry, but something unholy,
Addiction's the passenger, takin' it slowly.

[Chorus]
Full gooner mode… I lose control.
Plastic sheets draped 'round my soul.
I'm not the butcher that you all were told,
I'm fallin', I'm broken, full gooner mode.

[Verse 2]
Ocean breeze can't wash me clean,
Every reflection's a darker scene.
I used to slice the wicked away,
Now it's myself that I can't escape.

Doakes in the corner, sayin' "Surprise, motherfucker,"
But what I'm hidin' even worse undercover.
No bodies to bury, no rivers that flow,
Just me and my demons… full gooner mode.

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not justice, it's not fate,
It's a hunger I can't satiate.
Harry's ghost don't guide me home,
I'm lost forever, gooner alone.

[Chorus]
Full gooner mode… I lose control.
Plastic sheets draped 'round my soul.
I'm not the butcher that you all were told,
I'm fallin', I'm broken, full gooner mode.

[Outro]
Miami sleeps, but I don't close my eyes…
The Bay can't save me, no alibis.
The moonlight whispers, the secrets I hold…
Dexter's gone missing… I'm full gooner mode.`

    lyrics: `🎵 "Soy un Gooner" (Spanish Version)

[Verso 1]
En la bahía brillan luces,
yo camino sin razón.
Un secreto entre las sombras,
mi condena, mi pasión.

De día soy sonrisa quieta,
analista sin calor…
pero de noche me consumo,
soy gooner sin control.

[Coro]
Modo gooner…
mi alma se esconde en el mar.
Modo gooner…
ya no me puedo salvar.
Lo que Harry nunca pudo perdonar,
en la luna lo vuelvo a ocultar.

[Verso 2]
Entre plásticos y silencios,
no hay cadáver, no hay perdón.
Solo un vicio que me quema,
un deseo sin redención.

Doakes me mira en la penumbra,
Deb pregunta "¿qué pasó?"
Yo sonrío, miento al aire,
pero dentro… ya murió.

[Coro]
Soy un gooner…
mi alma se esconde en el mar.
Modo gooner…
ya no me puedo salvar.
Lo que Harry nunca pudo perdonar,
en la luna lo vuelvo a ocultar.

[Outro]
En el puerto suena el viento,
nadie sabe quién soy yo.
Bay Harbor no guarda huellas…
solo un gooner… y su dolor.`
